WARM-UP TASKS - 

FOR register.html

1. Add another element to the carousel - use random picture and text
2. Change the scaling of the benefits section below 900px screen size - divide elements into 2 rows with 3 elements each. Make icons a little bit bigger on hover.
3. Add a script adding a new div with a violet button inside in it (linking do Google maps) to the map element



MAIN TASKS - Work with pure code and show us what kind of changes you would make to fullfill the task. Remember to put comments of your every step, as in this case, we are more interested in seeing your train of thought, instead of 100% working component.
